Final project for CIS 152 - Data Structures

INSTRUCTIONS: 
To use this program, start by pressing the number that corresponds with the item you wish to add to the cart.

After each selection, you will recieve a prompt asking if you want to continue. Press Y to continue, or Q to quit.

You may press C at any time in the main screen to checkout. After checking out, the current user will be popped from the queue, 
and the next in line will be pushed to the front. (NOTE: I have not implemented the checkout function with the "continue shopping" prompt yet,
so if you want to checkout, make sure to press Y to continue first, and then press C from the main screen.)

When you are finished using the program, you can search This PC in File Explorer for a file called "ForstersAutoReceipt.txt". 
This should show the money totals for the most recent transaction. 

Thank you!
